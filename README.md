## :running: One-liner
LearnLab AI is a web application that allows users to construct Machine Learning models without the need for coding, with integration and assistance from OpenAI.

## :computer: Technology Stack
Hosted on [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) as a web application and integrated with OpenAI's API. Key libraries include Pandas, Numpy, sklearn, Seaborn and Sqlite.

## :boom: Core Technical Concepts and Inspiration
Utilizes a fully customizable pipeline to create machine learning model.

## :wrench: Configuration
